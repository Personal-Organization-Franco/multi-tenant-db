## DEPENDENCIES & HANDOFFS

### Critical Path Items
1. **P1.1.1 â†’ D1.1.1**: Requirements analysis complete, schema design ready to start
2. **D1.1.1 â†’ D1.2.1**: Schema design must complete before database configuration
3. **B1.1.1 â†’ B1.1.2**: FastAPI structure required before dependency configuration
4. **B1.1.2 + D1.1.2 â†’ G1.1.1**: Both Python and Docker setup must complete before initial commit

### Inter-Agent Dependencies
- **database-architect â†’ python-backend-architect**: Schema design influences model implementation
- **python-backend-architect â†’ database-architect**: Session management patterns affect connection pooling
- **All technical agents â†’ git-operations-manager**: All deliverables require commits

### Knowledge Handoffs Required
- **Database Schema Design** (D1.1.1): RLS strategy needs coordination with backend implementation
- **FastAPI Structure** (B1.1.1): API routing patterns must align with database access patterns

## DECISIONS LOG

### 2025-08-05 - Project Coordination System
- **Decision**: Implement rigorous BEFORE/AFTER task coordination protocol
- **Rationale**: Ensure no conflicts between agents and maintain clear progress tracking
- **Impact**: All agents must update PROJECT_STATUS.md before/after each task
- **Decided By**: project-manager-planner

### 2025-08-05 - Documentation Strategy
- **Decision**: Minimal comments policy for SQL and Python code
- **Rationale**: Focus on clean, self-documenting code over extensive commenting
- **Impact**: Comments only for complex business logic and RLS policies
- **Decided By**: project-manager-planner (per PROJECT_PLAN.md)

### 2025-08-05 - RLS Implementation Strategy  
- **Decision**: Hybrid approach combining application-level tenant context with database RLS
- **Rationale**: Balance security with performance and development complexity
- **Impact**: Both SET LOCAL tenant_id and application logic required
- **Decided By**: database-architect (external consultation)

### 2025-08-05 - SQLAlchemy vs Raw SQL Architecture
- **Decision**: Use SQLAlchemy ORM with careful attention to RLS integration
- **Rationale**: Better maintainability, type safety, and development velocity vs raw SQL performance gains
- **Impact**: All database interactions through SQLAlchemy, custom RLS session management required
- **Decided By**: database-architect (comprehensive analysis)

### 2025-08-05 - Project Coordination Success
- **Decision**: BEFORE/AFTER task protocols mandatory for all agents
- **Rationale**: Today's coordination worked seamlessly - institutionalize the approach
- **Impact**: All future tasks must follow established coordination templates
- **Decided By**: project-manager-planner (based on successful coordination today)

## RISK MONITORING

### Current Risks
1. **RLS Complexity** (HIGH): Complex security requirements may cause delays
   - **Mitigation**: Start with simple policies, test incrementally
   - **Owner**: database-architect
   
2. **Agent Coordination** (MEDIUM): Multiple agents working on foundation simultaneously
   - **Mitigation**: Strict BEFORE/AFTER protocol and dependency tracking
   - **Owner**: project-manager-planner

3. **Docker Configuration** (LOW): PostgreSQL 17 setup may have compatibility issues
   - **Mitigation**: Use established Docker images and configuration patterns
   - **Owner**: database-architect

### Resolved Risks
- None yet

## QUALITY GATES STATUS

### Phase 1 Completion Criteria
- [ ] Database schema created and migrated  
- [ ] Basic RLS policies implemented and tested
- [ ] FastAPI application structure complete

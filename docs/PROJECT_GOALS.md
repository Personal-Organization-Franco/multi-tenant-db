# Project Goals

## Executive Summary

The Multi-Tenant Database project demonstrates secure multi-tenancy implementation using PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS) in a fintech context. This project serves as a reference implementation for building secure, scalable multi-tenant applications with clear tenant isolation and hierarchical access patterns.

### 1. Demonstrate Multi-Tenant Architecture
**Goal**: Implement a production-ready multi-tenant database system that showcases industry best practices for tenant isolation and data security.

**Success Criteria**:
- Complete tenant isolation using PostgreSQL RLS policies
- Hierarchical access control (parent organizations can access subsidiaries)
- Zero cross-tenant data leakage
- Database-level security that cannot be bypassed by application code

### 2. Showcase Fintech Use Case
**Goal**: Create a realistic fintech scenario demonstrating how financial institutions can manage organizational hierarchies while maintaining strict data separation.

**Success Criteria**:
- Working example with banking organizations (HSBC, Barclays)
- Parent-subsidiary relationships (HSBC â†’ HSBC HK, HSBC London)
- Clear business logic for financial institution data management
- Realistic API operations for tenant management

### 3. Implement Clean Architecture
**Goal**: Build a maintainable, well-structured codebase following clean architecture principles and Python best practices.

**Success Criteria**:
- Clear separation of concerns across presentation, business, and data layers
- One class per file organization
- Complete type hints and PEP 8 compliance
- Zero linting errors or code quality issues
- Maximum 300 lines per file constraint

### 4. Enable Local Development
**Goal**: Provide a seamless local development experience with containerized infrastructure and simple project management.

**Success Criteria**:
- One-command setup with Docker Compose
- Comprehensive Makefile with all necessary commands
- Hot reload development environment
- Easy database seeding and reset capabilities

## Secondary Objectives

### 1. Technology Stack Demonstration
**Goal**: Showcase modern Python development practices using the latest stable versions of key technologies.

**Technologies**:
- Python 3.13.5 with modern async/await patterns
- FastAPI 0.116.1 with automatic OpenAPI documentation
- SQLAlchemy 2.0.41 with modern async ORM features
- PostgreSQL 17.5 with advanced RLS capabilities
- UV package manager for fast dependency management

### 2. API Design Excellence
**Goal**: Create a RESTful API that demonstrates best practices in API design and documentation.

**Success Criteria**:
- Maximum 6 endpoints maintaining simplicity
- Consistent response formats and error handling
- Auto-generated OpenAPI documentation
- Clear request/response schemas with validation

### 3. Database Design Best Practices
**Goal**: Implement optimal database design patterns for multi-tenant applications.

**Success Criteria**:
- Efficient indexing strategy for multi-tenant queries
- Proper foreign key relationships and constraints
- Alembic migrations with rollback capabilities
- Optimized connection pooling and resource management
